# Frida Patch Testing Framework - Example Configuration
#
# This example shows how to use a custom fork of frida-gum
# while using official repositories (with patches) for other components.
#
# Use Cases:
#   1. Testing your own fork before submitting a PR
#   2. Testing patches from others
#   3. Building with specific modifications

frida:
  # Version: "latest" clones the default branch
  # Or specify a tag like "16.5.2" for a specific release
  version: "latest"

components:
  # Example: Using a custom fork for frida-gum
  frida-gum:
    source: "custom"
    repository: "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/frida-gum"
    branch: "my-feature-branch"  # Optional, defaults to main/master

  # Example: Official with patches enabled
  frida-core:
    source: "official"
    patches: true  # Applies all patches from patches/frida-core/

  # Example: Official without patches
  frida-python:
    source: "official"
    patches: false  # Skip patches for this component

  # Example: Another custom fork
  frida-tools:
    source: "official"
    patches: true

build:
  # Available targets: frida-server, frida-python, frida-tools
  targets:
    - frida-server

  # "auto" detects host architecture
  # Or specify: "arm64", "x86_64"
  architecture: "auto"

  # Enable for debugging Frida itself
  debug: false

output:
  directory: "./output"
  artifacts:
    - frida-server
